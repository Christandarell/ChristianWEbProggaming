     <!--How  Cook The Steak Perfectly--> 
    <ol>
        <li>Take the steaks out of the refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This helps them cook more evenly.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Clean the grates and lightly oil them to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Mix the kosher salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and smoked paprika in a small bowl. This will be your seasoning mix.</li>
        <li>Pat the steaks dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. Rub them all over with olive oil to help the seasoning stick.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the seasoning mix evenly over both sides of the steaks, pressing gently to adhere.</li>
        <li>Place the steaks on the grill and cook for about 6-7 minutes per side for medium-rare, or until they reach your desired doneness. Flip them once halfway through cooking.</li>
        <li>Once done, remove the steaks from the grill and let them rest for 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, keeping the steaks juicy and tender.</li>
        <li>After resting, slice the steaks against the grain and serve immediately. Enjoy your perfectly grilled steak!</li>
